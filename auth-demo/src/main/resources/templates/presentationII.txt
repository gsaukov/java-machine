    Resource owner(User) Consent/Permission.
    Client (Application) (Confidential can keep a secret(server side running), Public cannot(User controlled, Embeded things, JS SPA, mobile)) (Client ID, Client Secret/PKCE, Scope, RedirectUri, State) https://habr.com/ru/post/422765/ https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQNwifDq1U
    Authorization Server
    Resource Server
    Authorization grant(Flow)
    Access Token
    Refresh Token
    OpenId https://openid.net/developers/specs/ https://connect2id.com/learn/openid-connect
    Front channel (more secure)
    Back Channel (less secure)

Things that solves OAuth 2.0
    Simple Login. - Authentication
    Single Sign on. - Authentication
    Mobile App Login - Authentication
    Delegated Authorization. - Authorization

Problems:
    No standard on user information or set of scopes. And its not getting better.
    Custom or confusing implementations.

Oauth 2.0 and OpenId
    Oauth 2.0 - is Authorization protocol.
        Granting access to your API.
        Getting access to user data in other systems. (Pull)
    OpenId - is Authentication protocol
        Logging in.
        Making your accounts availible in other systems. (Push.)
    Usually you will see combination of them.

Flow grant type use case:
    Web application with backend - authorization code flow.
    Native mobile app - authorization code flow with PKCE (client secret is not exposed.)
    JavaScript app(SPA) with out backend (only front channel) - Implicit flow.
    Microservices and Backend flow only - client credentials.
    Web application and backend both get access token - Hybrid Flow.

Token Validation
    Local validation (Fast)
        Expiration
        Cryptogrphic signature.
    Introspection (Slow)
        Call to authorization server.

Revokation
    Url based.
    introspection based.

Refresh token
    Sent user back to auth server (if he has session it will be super quick).
    Call auth server yourself exchanging refresh token for new access token and refresh token.

Multy factor support in single place (Auth server).
