Hi

I did the test.

In the attachment you will find relayr source code archive and RSystemDesign.xlsx archive.

RSystemDesign.xlsx archive -  is solution of "Relayr Onboarding Big Data Deep-Dive" problem

relayr archive - is solution of "Relayr Onboarding Java Test" problem.

Java test solution has no main class. Only library covered with tests.
You can import it into your IDE as gradle project so you can review source code build/test it using IDE.
Or
You can clean build and test this library by cd to "/relayr" folder and executing "./gradlew clean build"
This will generate build folder with test-results and jar libs/relayr-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar

Please let me know if you have any questions or there are any issues with the solutions

Thank you,
Georgy
