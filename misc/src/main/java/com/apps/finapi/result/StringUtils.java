 * TODO:
 * Write a utility class with a method that you can pass a Collection of strings, and which returns a new List of
 * strings according to the following criteria:
 * <p>
 * - the returned list contains only those strings from the given collection that are non-blank (NOT null and NOT whitespace-only)
 * - all strings that are contained in the returned list are trimmed (leading/trailing whitespace is removed)
 * - all strings that are contained in the returned list are converted to upper-case
 * - the returned list contains no duplicates
 * - the returned list has the strings ordered by their length (ascending; strings of the same length may be randomly ordered)
 * <p>
 * NOTE: This method is intended to be used with huge collections, so performance is an issue.
