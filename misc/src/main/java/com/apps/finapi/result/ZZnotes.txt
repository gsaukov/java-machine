For the results see com.apps.finapi.result.* package.
Initial challenge is in com.apps.finapi.challenge.*
You might need to add your own gradle/maven configuration to run the project.

All code was adjusted to production standards and covered with the tests.
Some method signatures were changed to better reflect their purpose.

CollectionUtils - replaced return type long with int to meet max possible Collection valid size.
Replaced method argument ArrayList with Collection interface expanding it and inlining with class name.

InstantiationCounter - System.out hard to cover with unit test using Scanner, can be covered with Integration/System test.

Pipeline - problem solved via classic solution from Oracle https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/concurrent/locks/Condition.html.
As I understood Producer/Consumer inner classes and method main are used to manually check console for correctness of implementation?
Replaced it with proper unit test PipelineTest that simulates race conditions and checks the multythreaded consistency.

StringUtils - Algorithmic problem solved in nlogn. Backed with test.

TransactionIdentifier - Replaced wrong original equals/hashCode with correct generated by IDE. Was doubting about the necessity of the test, but let it be.
